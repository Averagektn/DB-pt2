 Databases part 2

## Lab 1
 * Create backups of received databases

## Lab 2
### Write the following SQL queries: 
 * Show all author information
 * Show all genre information
 * Show how many readers borrowed books from the library
 * Show how many books were returned and not returned to the library (the DBMS should operate on the original values of the sb_is_active field (i.e., "Y" and "N"), and after counting, the "Y" and "N" values should be converted to "Returned" and "Not returned")
 * Show the ID of the one (any) reader who borrowed the most books from the library
